##Hi! I'm Rishika.

Iâ€™m a UX designer with experience in a fast paced working environments who tackles design problem from multiple points of views. I intend to work on problems of diverse scope and craft a vision to set a project up for long-term success. My process-oriented workflow, analytical and observant nature helps me to develop smart design solutions to enhance the user experience. 

I'm currently working as a product designer for Power Automate (Microsoft flow), where my objectives are to increase the monthly active user rates and NPS score for the product. 

If you like my work I am available for full-time and freelance opportunities in the Seattle area. Please feel free to send me an email at jamwalrishika@gmail.com
