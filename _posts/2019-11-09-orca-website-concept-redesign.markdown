PROJECT BRIEF

The ORCA card is a stored value smart card used for payment of public transport fares in the Puget Sound region of Washington state, United States. This project aims redesigning the current website and introducing an improved shopping experience.

TOOLS

Omnigraffle, Sketch and Invision

THE CHALLENGE

The ORCA website allows the user to buy, monitor and manage transit card, however, the website consists of redundant information and a complicated e-commerce experience.

DESIGN PROCESS

I followed learn UX process. I started the process with research about the brand and their business goals, and moved towards solving the problems of the persona.

Research

Business I started my research by knowing more about the brand, and it’s business goals. As I went further deep in my research I found a Joint Board Program Management Report available at King County Metro’s website. The details of the report helped me to identify the business goals

The above statistics show how most of the sales happens through Ticket Vending Machines followed by the website. 
TVM are expensive to maintain, therefore shifting the users towards website can be more useful.

This another graph helped me identify that the users of Reduced Card Category are highly fluctuating.
ORCA is presently promoting the use of Reduced Fare Youth ORCA cards in order to attract the next generation of transit riders and promote the use of public transport for the environment.

BRAND

As the brand’s tag line says“Orca Gets you Moving”

Orca intends to simplify the transit options for the convenience of it’s customers in order to increase the ridership of public transport agencies.
The increase in ridership will in turn increase the revenue for all the participating agencies.
Also want to increase the sales through website to reduce the costs of maintenance of ticket vending machines.
USER RESEARCH

To understand common problems I interviewed people and also did contextual inquiry, some of my findings were:
I created an affinity diagram which helped me to summarize user interview results
I created an affinity diagram which helped me to summarize user interview results

After contextual inquiry some users mentioned that they still weren’t clear about the structure of the website.
The terminology such as ‘Get a Card’ or ‘Have a Card’, ‘E-purse’ or ‘Pass’ confused even some existing users.
Some users disclosed that complexity of the website makes them use kiosk more often.
They shared that they didn’t prefer to go online just because the user have to log in for every task and site takes lot of effort as compared to the other options available.
Many users didn’t even know about all the modes of transportation available.
There is no clear pricing information available.
After doing some heuristics analysis of the homepage, I concluded that the homepage fails to serve the purpose of:

Buying a card/pass easily
Adding value without log in
Locating the Customer Care easily
Non-functional search bar
CARD SORTING

For information architecture I wanted to know more about how users would like to see their homepage, which features would they like on their global nav-bar and which ones on footer or somewhere else, therefore, I planned on doing some card sorting.

The card sorting also helped me labeling the categories and segregating certain information under particular categories.

It was interesting to see how different the results can be from user to user, some wanted to group information in nav-bar while some preferred to see more data directly displayed at the home page.
COMPARATIVE AND COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

I did a competitive analysis of the transit system cards of the other cities with similar population or the class of the cities. It helped me to know about the features offered by other websites.

Persona

The target audience of Orca website are from a variety of backgrounds however its much easier for the user of younger generation to use websites as compared to senior citizens. The senior boarding on public transport is increasing therefore there is a need of creating a stronger relationship of the website and the senior users for their ease.

Scenario

I created a scenario for Daniella's first user flow.

Problem Statement

Redesign the Orca card website by making the 'Buy a reduced Fare Card' process easier for Daniella and also help her to add the value in the Orca Card quickly.

Solution

Introduction of a new or improved shopping experience by making the process of buying a reduced fare card easier by the following process:

Introduction of the quick access tool which will help the users to quickly reload the card and register the unregistered card as a guest.

Information Architecture

Old Site Map

I first created a site map of the present website, some of my other findings were:
There is no proper information to order or check balance as a guest (without logging in)
Repetitive information
Various contact informations of transit agencies and orca care but no clear way to find them
Information to create business accounts at the footer, links to other website
New Site Map

Header and footer details remain the same. The repetition of content has been reduced.
The global nav consists of - Shop ORCA category which let’s the user buy car and add value and pass to their card.
Reduced Fare Cards have a different page on global nav, a beneficial feature for Daniella.
The Price Page simply let’s you know about the fare prices of the passes available.
All the contact details (ORCA and transit agencies) has been moved to Contact together.

Interaction Design

USER FLOWS

User flows helped me to decide the navigation pattern of the user and the steps she will take to reach his desired outcome. First I drew User flow of the present Orca Website, this helped me to gain an in-depth understanding of the present website

Sketches

Sketches helped me identify the basic layout of the Home Page. I wanted to make sure that all the important info is clearly visible and segregated in the right category so that Daniella easy navigates through the site and quickly finds what she needs

Wireframes

The wireframes were made on Sketch App, some of the annotated screens are:

Prototype

I made only low-fidelity prototypes using Invision


User Testing and Iterations

The register and sign up process was also confusing to a few users. So, I created a signup button right next to log in.

The product list had too much data on a single screen and I also realized that a user of Daniella’s age may find it very difficult to read the details of the pass they want to select.
The solution was to create a selection tool where a user first selects the type of pass he requires and after that can select any pass he requires from that category.

The buttons ‘Quick Reload’ and ‘Register’ at the Quick Access tool were confusing to some. I think the bold color of one tab confused the users more and they weren’t sure about which tab was open.

The solution was to create a feature that was clearly readable to the users. I got inspired from chrome browser and removed the line separating the box from the text to show that the text is part of the box opened.

Next Steps

I believe my process lacked interviewing people of Daniella’s age group. It would have been beneficial to know do some more user testing and interviews to know better understanding of user flow and their requirements
I also want to work in detail with navigation of other features present on the website.
And work on it’s visual design focusing on the needs of age group senior citizens.

Personal Findings

The card sorting exercise was very informative, it showed how each user has own priorities and expectations. As information architect it helped me to make the global nav-bar and footer as intuitive as possible.
In this project my persona helped me to see things from perspective of a senior citizen
This was a solo project, hence, I played various roles in this project, and for my future projects it helped me to understand the importance of working closely with other roles of the UX, as each step is highly dependent on another.
